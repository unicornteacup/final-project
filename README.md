# BC Parks 2.0

It is an improved application of an existing BC Parks website where hikers apply for a day-pass. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all hikers must require a day-pass to hike at a BC provincial park. Unfortunately, due to large volumes of people at once, the server crashes frequently, or the passes are sold out within minutes at 6 am. To solve this problem, we have made an improved version of the website with a lottery system where people can apply for the hiking pass two days before the desired hiking date. We have also created My Bookings page where people can keep track of previous entries and the lottery results. We have incorporated Twillio to receive texts for identity confirmation and receive the QR code that the hiker can present to a park ranger on the hike's day.
